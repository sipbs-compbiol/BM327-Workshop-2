::: { .callout-note }
It may take a couple of minutes to install the necessary packages in `WebR` - please be patient.

In this section you will meet `ggplot2`, a very popular and powerful data visualisation package in `R`. We will also learn about the "grammar of graphics," a way of thinking about constructing data visualisations that also is the source of the `gg` in `ggplot2`.

## Loading data

In order to visualise data using `ggplot2` in `R`, we have to load it. We have provided the data for this walkthrough in the file `gapminder.csv`, which can be loaded with the command:

```r
gapminder <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
```

```{webr-r}
# Load data from "gapminder.csv" into a dataframe in R
# gapminder <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")


```
