# An introduction to `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is a very widely-used, expressive, and extremely powerful data visualisation package in `R`. Many of the graphics you may have seen at websites and media organisations like the _Financial Times_, _The Economist_, _FiveThirtyEight_, _The Athletic_ and so on are generated using `R`. It is also widely used in the NHS.

In this section, you will be introduced to `ggplot2` and use it interactively to generate complex plots of socioeconomic data, to get some practice and facility with the tool.

Later in the workshop you will use `ggplot2` to visualise real experimental data from a gene knockout/complementation experiment.
