# Experimental results { #sec-experimental-results }

As noted in @sec-experiment, we aim to identify UPEC-specific genes that are overrepresented in the final mixtures that have been through mouse passage, but that are not overrepresented in the control passage through culture alone.

These results were obtained using a Bayesian statistical multilevel regression technique, and are presented graphically below. As the UPEC genome comprises a chromosome and an accompanying plasmid, these are shown separately.

Results are shown for both post-control, and post-mouse passage arms of the experiment.

The statistical methodology is beyond the scope of this workshop. But please do ask if you're interested.
