# Experimental results { #sec-experimental-results }

As noted in @sec-experiment, we aim to identify UPEC-specific genes that are overrepresented in the final mixtures that have been through mouse passage, but that are not overrepresented in the control passage through culture alone.

These results were obtained using a Bayesian statistical multilevel regression technique, and are presented graphically below. As the UPEC genome comprises a chromosome and an accompanying plasmid, these are shown separately.

Results are shown for both post-control, and post-mouse passage arms of the experiment.

## Interpreting the experimental results

We are interested in genes that are more abundant than expected after mouse passage, but not after control passage.

### Chromosomal genes

Comparing @fig-chrom-control and @fig-chrom-treat we can see that in both cases there are clusters of genes that appear to be overrepresented, and they are different for the control- and mouse-passaged arms of the experiment.

In the mouse-passaged isolates, four regions known as "S-loops" were seen to be enriched. These encode for urea degradation, effector proteins associated with adherence to bovine tissue, a surfactin, and h√¶m utilisation. The known functions of these genes are consistent with a role in adherence to tissue, and infection.

### Plasmid-borne genes

A comparison of @fig-plasmid-control and @fig-plasmid-treat shows that no plasmid-borne genes are overrepresented in the control arm, but that a run of several genes corresponding to an operon for a Type II Secretion System (T2SS) are highlighted in the mouse arm. This T2SS has been reported to play a role in adherence to mammalian host tissues, biofilm formation, and is considered an important virulence factor. 

### Identifying a candidate

The T2SS was chosen as a likely candidate for investigation, given its known roles in host tissue association and infection.
