    "text": "1.1 Overview\nThis workshop asks you to carry out data analysis and visualisation to identify an adhesion factor important for urinary tract infection. You will be using the statistical programming language R and the widely-used graphics library ggplot2 to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\n\n\nThere is new material in this workshop that is not covered in lectures, and this material is examinable. Please take care to read the text in the expandable callout boxes, as well as that for the workshop, to be sure you have understood the topic and obtain full value from the exercise.\nThe workshop material will remain live online for the duration of BM327, and you can revisit it whenever you wish, for practice or revision.\n\n\nYou should be able to complete this workshop in under two hours.",
