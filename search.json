Each group of five measurements may have been obtained on a different day, by a different scientist.\nSmall differences between the way scientists work, or batches of chemicals, media, and reagents, can lead to systematic differences in results that are due to those changes and not to the biological influence under investigation (here, the effect of the etpD gene on bacterial adherence).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhen inspecting experimental data, you should check for potential signs of batch effects using exploratory data visualisation. The visualisation you performed above is exploratory data visualisation.\n\nDo datapoints that are meant to measure the same thing seem to form distinct and separate clusters?\nIf you colour the datapoints by a factor that is not meant to be a factor of interest in the experimental design (e.g. individual experimenter, date the measurement was obtained, media batch number) do these correlate with the clusters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome common visualisation and ordination techniques for identifying batch effects include PCA (principal components analysis) and MDS (multidimenstional scaling).\nRigorous experimental design is the best way to avoid batch effects and confounding. Techniques such as sample randomisation and statistical balancing can help to avoid unwanted and unanticipated batch effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo you see evidence of batch effects in Figure 3.1 and/or Figure 3.2? Why do you think this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is clear visual evidence of batch effects in both Figure 3.1 and/or Figure 3.2.\nFor example, in Figure 3.1 the logCFU values for batches 1 and 2 are obviously grouped together and differ from each other, despite apparently measuring the same values. The evidence for a batch effect is less obvious for batches 3 and 4.\nLikewise in Figure 3.2 the values for batch 5 are much lower than those for the other empty and complement batches. Values for batches 1 and 2 also appear to be systematically lower than for the other batches in the WT and KO lines.",

    "section": "4.2 The Model",
    "text": "4.2 The Model\nWe can consider the measured “stickiness” or adherence of the bacteria to be composed of the combined influence of a number of factors. We can use our experimental results and a statistical method called linear modelling (or linear regression) to estimate the amount of influence each factor has.\nFirst though, we start with a baseline level of “stickiness…”\n\n4.2.1 The baseline: wild-type adherence (WT)\nThe wild-type (control) line is expected to display the baseline level of adherence for the bacteria.\nSo, when we measure the WT line we are establishing the natural baseline “stickiness” of the bacterium, measured as logCFU recovered from the substrate. In statistical terms we might make this into an equation like:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline}  \\tag{4.1}\\]\nand Equation 4.1 says “the logCFU we measure for any wild-type bacterium is that of the baseline, wild-type organism.”\nIn reality though, we always expect some completely random experimental measurement error, which we can represent with the symbol \\(\\epsilon\\) (epsilon) as Equation 4.2:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\epsilon  \\tag{4.2}\\]\ni.e. “the logCFU we measure for any wild-type bacterium is that of the baseline, wild-type organism, plus or minus some measurement error.”\n\n\n4.2.2 The first intervention: knocking out a gene of interest (KO)\nIf we don’t knock out a gene from a bacterium it is just the same as the wild type. We’d expect the logCFU we recover from the substrate to be the baseline logCFU.\nBut, if we do knock out a gene, we can represent the measured logCFU for that bacterium by Equation 4.3:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\epsilon  \\tag{4.3}\\]\nwhich says “the logCFU we measure for the bacterium is the baseline level, plus the effect of knocking out the gene.”\nEssentially the difference in measured logCFU between the WT and KO groups is taken to be due to the effect of knocking out the gene of interest (plus or minus a bit of measurement error).\n\n\n4.2.3 Introducing the empty vector (empty)\nIntroducing an empty plasmid vector puts strain on a bacterium and might affect its “stickiness.” As we only introduce the empty vector into a knockout strain, the measured logCFU for that bacterium is that of the baseline plus the effect of the knockout, and any effect of including the empty vector. We can describe this in Equation 4.5:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\textrm{empty} + \\epsilon  \\tag{4.4}\\]\nwhich says “the logCFU we measure for the bacterium is the baseline level, plus the effect of knocking out the gene of interest, and the effect of introducing an empty vector (plus or minus some measurement error).”\n\n\n4.2.4 Complementing the gene (complement)\nFinally, reintroducing the gene on the plasmid vector (complementing the gene) is expected to change the logCFU recovered. The effect of introducing the gene is added on to the effect of knocking it out and introducing an empty plasmid, and is described in Equation 4.5:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\textrm{empty} + \\textrm{complement} + \\epsilon  \\tag{4.5}\\]\n\n\n4.2.5 So what?\nBy now you might be thinking: “we’ve made an equation that represents the quantitative influence of knocking out a gene, introducing an empty plasmid, and complementing the gene, but so what? - how do we get numbers for this?”\nTo get those numbers, we can use a statistical technique called linear modelling (aka linear regression). It is very powerful and useful, and remarkably straightforward to use in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will walk through the modelling process for the catheter data, but modelling the tissue data is left as an exercise for you to solve.",
