The scientists involved knew that there might be an infuence on the outcome and took it into account when recording their data.\nHowever, many such interfering effects can creep into experimental data without our realising it. It is always good practice to investigate your experimental data to look for evidence of similar kinds of effects.\nAs you will see, it can be possible to account and correct for these effects when they arise.",

Each group of five measurements contained results for only one of the WT (control), KO (knockout), empty (empty vector), and complement (complemented gene) groups. There were four such groups or batches for the human tissue experiment, and eight for the catheter material experiment. with four such batches of five measurements for each",
