    "text": "2.4 The grammar of graphics\nTo really get to grips with ggplot2 we need to talk about what makes up a plot. We can use the example of the scatterplot you’ve just generated (reproduced in Figure 2.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The result of the qplot() command showing GDP per capita against life expectancy, with points coloured by continent\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Aesthetics\nIn this plot, every row in the table (we call each row an observation) is represented by a single point. How that point is rendered in the plot is determined by its aesthetics:\n\nThe x position aesthetic determines where the point is rendered in relation to the side of the graph\nThe y position aesthetic determines where the point is rendered in relation to the bottom of the graph\nThe size of the point is an aesthetic\nThe shape of the point is an aesthetic\nThe colour of the point is an aesthetic\nThe transparency of the point is an aesthetic\n\nIn ggplot2 these aesthetics can be constant (like shape in Figure 2.1), or mapped to - under the control of - variables in the dataset (like colour in Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe can generate many different kinds of plot from the same data just by changing the aesthetics\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 geoms\nThe other key thing to know about in ggplot2 is the idea of a geometry, or geom. The geom determines the kind of data representation for the plot. There are many kinds of geom in ggplot2, and combinations of aesthetic and geom can reproduce several kinds of plot (as in Figure 2.2).\nAll ggplot2 graphs are combinations of geoms and aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Combinations of aesthetic and geom that make different plot types.\n\n\n\nWe can demonstrate this in the WebR cell below. Use the following code to create a scatterplot:\np &lt;- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))\np + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first line uses the ggplot() command to create the plot from the dataset (data=gapminder) with a set of aesthetics (aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent)). This plot is put into a variable (p) for convenience so that we can experiment in the workshop.\nJust defining the graph isn’t enough to show it. To do this we also need a geom\nBecause the plot is in the variable p, we can “add” a geom to it. We’ll add geom_point() so that it gives us a scatterplot, like that in Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nReplace the geom_point() in the WebR code with geom_line(). Does this give a better representation of the dataset?\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Layers\nWithout even thinking about it, we’ve been using the concept of layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll ggplot2 plots are built from layers.\n\n\nAll layers have two components:\n\ndata that will be shown, and aesthetics for showing the data\na geom the defines the type of plot on that layer\n\nThe layers in the plot you created above are shown in Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ggplot() layer is the “base layer” and contains data and aesthetics (aes()). These are inherited by the other layers in the plot, such as the geom_point() layer (unless overridden).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The layers present in the scatterplot you created. The blue ggplot() layer is the “base layer” and contains data and aesthetics (aes()). These are inherited by the other layers in the plot, such as the orange geom_point() layer (unless overridden).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUsing the WebR cell below, create a plot showing how life expectancy (lifeExp) changes as a function of time (year), as a scatterplot.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need a hint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you generate the graph by just changing variables in the code you’ve already written?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp, I’m stuck!\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the same code as above, but put year on the x aesthetic/axis, and lifeExp on the y aesthetic/axis.\np &lt;- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, color=continent))\np + geom_point()\n\n\n\nWe can build up additional layers of geoms to create more complex plots, and to apply aesthetics specifically to different layers. For example, we can plot GDP per capita (gdpPercap) against life expectancy (lifeExp) as a line plot (geom_line()), grouping points by country, but coloured by continent. The code for this is:\np &lt;- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))\np + geom_line(aes(group=country))\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe layer structure of this plot is shown in Figure 2.4 (and the result in Figure 2.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: The layers of the line plot. The blue ggplot() layer is the “base layer” and contains data and aesthetics (aes()). These are inherited by the other layers in the plot, such as the orange geom_line() layer, but an additional aesthetic grouping points by country is added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Line plot showing data grouped by country, but coloured by continent\n\n\n\nWe can go on to add a top-level geom_point() scatterplot with each datapoint shown as a semitransparent (alpha=0.4) point by changing this code - in the same WebR cell to:\np &lt;- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))\np + geom_line(aes(group=country)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4)\nThis gives the plot in Figure 2.6, which has the layer structure in Figure 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Line plot showing data grouped by country, but coloured by continent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: The layers of the line plot with scatterplot layer.

UPECs are the most common cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and imfection can cause milder symptoms like discomfort, polyuria, and fever, but in some cases can lead to kidney damage, sepsis and death.\nOne of the features of UPECs that facilitaties infection is their ability to adhere (stick) to human tissue, and also to materials that might be inserted into the urinary tract, such as catheter tubes. The better, and longer, a pathogen can hang around in the urinary tract, the more chance it has to contribute to illness. If we can identify the molecular components contributing to adherence, we might be able to target them with drugs or produce materials to which they stick less well, reducing the disease burden.\nThe experiment whose data you will be working with aims to identity molecular causes of adherence through a high throughput positive selection screen, identifying genes that specifically appear to improve retention of bacteria in the urinary tract.",

If we can intervene to reduce this adherence, we can shorten the dwell time of the microbe and reduce the impact of disease.\nThe overall plan of the experiment is sketched in Figure 3.1.\nA bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library is constructed for an E. coli UPEC isolate.\nThe BAC library is then passaged through a mouse model (catheterised mouse) to emulate introduction to the human catheterised urinary tract. After passage and washing of the extracted catheter tube, the tube was used as inoculum for a further round of incubation to culture adherent bacteria.\nAfter passage, the total gDNA from the three control and three mouse system cultures is sequenced.

These encode for urea degradation, effector proteins associated with adherence to bovine tissue, a surfactin, and hæm utilisation. The known functions of these genes are consistent with a role in adherence to tissue, and infection.\n\n\n4.1.2 Plasmid-borne genes\nA comparison of Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4 shows that no plasmid-borne genes are overrepresented in the control arm, but that a run of several genes corresponding to an operon for a Type II Secretion System (T2SS) are highlighted in the mouse arm. This T2SS has been reported to play a role in adherence to mammalian host tissues, biofilm formation, and is considered an important virulence factor.\n\n\n4.1.3 Identifying a candidate\nThe T2SS was chosen as a likely candidate for investigation, given its known roles in host tissue association and infection. The etpD gene is a secretin that is critical for constructing the type II secretion apparatus, and knocking out this gene in a UPEC mutant is expected to prevent construction of a working type II secretion system.\nTo investigate the role of the type II secretion system in adherence to the urinary tract and/or catheter material, it was decided to construct a knockout mutant lacking the etpD gene: \\(\\Delta\\)etpD and to test experimentally its role in adherence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will be visualising and analysing the data from this experiment in the next section of the workshop.",

The experiment aims to satisfy Falkow’s molecular variant of Koch’s Postulates:\nThe first of these postulates can be tested using the wild-type/control strain of UPEC.\nFor this experiment either (i) strips of catheter tubing or (ii) human urinary tract tissue samples were washed and incubated in bacterial suspension (about \\(10^7\\) CFU in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), OD=0.02) for two hours at 18degC. On removal from suspension the material was vigorously washed three times with sterile PBS on a vortexer, weighed and homogenised.

If the bacteria do adhere well, then we should be able to recover more bacteria. In this way, logCFU is expected to be a proxy for bacterial adherence.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Making a knockout\nThe etpD sequence was obtained from the sequencing reads in the earlier experiment, and a defined deletion was constructed using allelic exchange. The deletion was confirmed to be successful using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and Sanger sequencing. The resulting strain is \\(\\Delta\\)etpD, and can be used to test the second part of the postulates above.\n\n\n5.1.2 Making a complemented strain\nTo test the third and final postulate, the \\(\\Delta\\)etpD strain must be complemented with an additional plasmid that reintroduces the etpD gene.\nMerely having the gene is not sufficient, though - the gene must also be expressed and produce the corresponding gene product (i.e. the protein EtpD). To ensure this happens, the etpD gene is introduced on a plasmid that contains an upstream promoter. It is convenient to make this promoter respond to a chemical signal that the experimenters provide, turning on expression of the gene and production of the EtpD protein.\nIn this experiment, the etpD gene was cloned into the IPTG (Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, a lactose mimic)-inducible plasmid pSE380, and this was transformed into the mutant \\(\\Delta\\)etpD strain.\n\n\n5.1.3 One more control\nTo establish whether or not the plasmid vector pSE380 by itself makes any contribution to adherence, the \\(\\Delta\\)etpD strain was also transformed with an “empty” pSE380 plasmid vector containing no etpD gene.\nThis was not necessary to test the postulates above, but it is good practice to eliminate an unexpected effect due only to the plasmid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRecovery of bacteria, measured as logCFU, was performed identically for wild-type/control, knockout, empty vector, and complemented strains.",

Each group of five measurements may have been obtained on a different day, by a different scientist.\nSmall differences between the way scientists work, or batches of chemicals, media, and reagents, can lead to systematic differences in results that are due to those changes and not to the biological influence under investigation (here, the effect of the etpD gene on bacterial adherence).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhen inspecting experimental data, you should check for potential signs of batch effects using exploratory data visualisation. The visualisation you performed above is exploratory data visualisation.\n\nDo datapoints that are meant to measure the same thing seem to form distinct and separate clusters?\nIf you colour the datapoints by a factor that is not meant to be a factor of interest in the experimental design (e.g. individual experimenter, date the measurement was obtained, media batch number) do these correlate with the clusters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome common visualisation and ordination techniques for identifying batch effects include PCA (principal components analysis) and MDS (multidimenstional scaling).\nRigorous experimental design is the best way to avoid batch effects and confounding. Techniques such as sample randomisation and statistical balancing can help to avoid unwanted and unanticipated batch effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo you see evidence of batch effects in Figure 6.1 and/or Figure 6.2? Why do you think this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is clear visual evidence of batch effects in both Figure 6.1 and/or Figure 6.2.\nFor example, in Figure 6.1 the logCFU values for batches 1 and 2 are obviously grouped together and differ from each other, despite apparently measuring the same values. The evidence for a batch effect is less obvious for batches 3 and 4.\nLikewise in Figure 6.2 the values for batch 5 are much lower than those for the other empty and complement batches. Values for batches 1 and 2 also appear to be systematically lower than for the other batches in the WT and KO lines.",

    "section": "7.2 The Model",
    "text": "7.2 The Model\nWe can consider the measured “stickiness” or adherence of the bacteria to be composed of the combined influence of a number of factors. We can use our experimental results and a statistical method called linear modelling (or linear regression) to estimate the amount of influence each factor has.\nFirst though, we start with a baseline level of “stickiness…”\n\n7.2.1 The baseline: wild-type adherence (WT)\nThe wild-type (control) line is expected to display the baseline level of adherence for the bacteria.\nSo, when we measure the WT line we are establishing the natural baseline “stickiness” of the bacterium, measured as logCFU recovered from the substrate. In statistical terms we might make this into an equation like:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline}  \\tag{7.1}\\]\nand Equation 7.1 says “the logCFU we measure for any wild-type bacterium is that of the baseline, wild-type organism.”\nIn reality though, we always expect some completely random experimental measurement error, which we can represent with the symbol \\(\\epsilon\\) (epsilon) as Equation 7.2:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\epsilon  \\tag{7.2}\\]\ni.e. “the logCFU we measure for any wild-type bacterium is that of the baseline, wild-type organism, plus or minus some measurement error.”\n\n\n7.2.2 The first intervention: knocking out a gene of interest (KO)\nIf we don’t knock out a gene from a bacterium it is just the same as the wild type. We’d expect the logCFU we recover from the substrate to be the baseline logCFU.\nBut, if we do knock out a gene, we can represent the measured logCFU for that bacterium by Equation 7.3:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\epsilon  \\tag{7.3}\\]\nwhich says “the logCFU we measure for the bacterium is the baseline level, plus the effect of knocking out the gene.”\nEssentially the difference in measured logCFU between the WT and KO groups is taken to be due to the effect of knocking out the gene of interest (plus or minus a bit of measurement error).\n\n\n7.2.3 Introducing the empty vector (empty)\nIntroducing an empty plasmid vector puts strain on a bacterium and might affect its “stickiness.” As we only introduce the empty vector into a knockout strain, the measured logCFU for that bacterium is that of the baseline plus the effect of the knockout, and any effect of including the empty vector. We can describe this in Equation 7.4:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\textrm{empty} + \\epsilon  \\tag{7.4}\\]\nwhich says “the logCFU we measure for the bacterium is the baseline level, plus the effect of knocking out the gene of interest, and the effect of introducing an empty vector (plus or minus some measurement error).”\n\n\n7.2.4 Complementing the gene (complement)\nFinally, reintroducing the gene on the plasmid vector (complementing the gene) is expected to change the logCFU recovered. The effect of introducing the gene is added on to the effect of knocking it out and introducing an empty plasmid, and is described in Equation 7.5:\n\\[ \\textrm{measured logCFU} = \\textrm{baseline} + \\textrm{knockout} + \\textrm{empty} + \\textrm{complement} + \\epsilon  \\tag{7.5}\\]\n\n\n7.2.5 So what?\nBy now you might be thinking: “we’ve made an equation that represents the quantitative influence of knocking out a gene, introducing an empty plasmid, and complementing the gene, but so what? - how do we get numbers for this?”\nTo get those numbers, we can use a statistical technique called linear modelling (aka linear regression). It is very powerful and useful, and remarkably straightforward to use in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will walk through the modelling process for the catheter data, but modelling the tissue data is left as an exercise for you to solve.",

The previous model looked like this:\nlogCFU ~ KO + empty + complement\nand the modified model requires the addition of only one term:\nlogCFU ~ KO + empty + complement + (1 | batch)\nSo, what does (1 | batch) mean?\n\n8.3.1 Fixed and random effects\nThe model we have built is now what’s called a “mixed model” that incorporates fixed effects and random effects. But what are they and why do they differ?\nFixed effects are the influences that we focus our practical experiments on. In our experiments we make a specific, intentional change to the system (e.g. knocking out a gene) that we expect to have a consistent effect on the outcome. The term “fixed” in “fixed effect” refers to the expectation of this effect being constant across individual runs of the experiment.\nRandom effects are influences on the outcome that can vary between individual runs (such as the “measurement error \\(\\epsilon\\) which reflects small random variations in each measurement), or between groups of runs - such as the batch-level differences we saw in Chapter 7. We expect that every measurement in the same batch is affected in approximately the same way, with some random error, but that the effect can differ between batches.\nThe part of the R model expressed by (1 | batch) represents this random effect due to a measurement being made in a particular batch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs before, we will walk through the modelling process for the catheter data, but modelling the tissue data is left as an exercise for you to solve.",

This is an intriguing result that requires explanation and, because we have been able to account for systematic sources of experimental error, i.e. batch effects, we can be confident in our conclusions and that there is a new question to be answered:\nWhy does knocking out etpD reduce recovery from catheter material and human tissue, but only restore recovery from catheter material?",
